A collection of interesting things I've discovered this month:

* [ASP.NET Core CSRF defence with Antiforgery](https://www.dotnetcurry.com/aspnet/1343/aspnet-core-csrf-antiforgery-token)
* [AsyncAPI Initiative](https://www.asyncapi.com/) - "the industry standard for defining asynchronous APIs"
* [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) - "Iconic font aggregator, collection, and patcher"

If you have a UK keyboard and try typing backslash into the Dell iDRACView application you might see # appear instead.

After a lot of experimentation and frustration, the only way I could find of doing this was to check _Keyboard > Hold Left Alt Key_ then type **92** on the keyboard number pad. Then uncheck _Keyboard > Hold Left Alt Key_ again.

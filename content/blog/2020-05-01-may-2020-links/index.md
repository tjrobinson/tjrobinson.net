A collection of interesting things I've discovered this month:

* [QA Wolf](https://github.com/qawolf/qawolf) - "Free and open source library to create Playwright/Jest browser tests and run them in CI"
* [Using Feature Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Feature_Policy/Using_Feature_Policy) - "Feature Policy allows you to control which origins can use which features, both in the top-level page and in embedded frames."

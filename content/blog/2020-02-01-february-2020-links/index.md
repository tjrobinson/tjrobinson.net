A collection of interesting things I've discovered this month:

* [WallabyJS](https://wallabyjs.com/) - commercial tool for JavaScript/TypeScript testing. The time travel debugging looks very useful.
* [How to migrate from Newtonsoft.Json to System.Text.Json](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json-migrate-from-newtonsoft-how-to) - this lists all the differences and what isn't supported - quite a lot currently.
* [Designing for Performance](http://designingforperformance.com/) - online version of the book.
* [Blazor Contacts](https://github.com/bradwellsb/blazor-contacts) - "A project template for OData API, IdentityServer4 auth, and server-side Blazor"

A collection of interesting things I've discovered this month:

* [WallabyJS](https://wallabyjs.com/) - commercial tool for JavaScript/TypeScript testing. The time travel debugging looks very useful.
* [How to migrate from Newtonsoft.Json to System.Text.Json](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/standard/serialization/system-text-json-migrate-from-newtonsoft-how-to) - this lists all the differences and what isn't supported - quite a lot currently.
* [Designing for Performance](http://designingforperformance.com/) - online version of the book.
* [Blazor Contacts](https://github.com/bradwellsb/blazor-contacts) - "A project template for OData API, IdentityServer4 auth, and server-side Blazor"
* [Nick Craver - Binding Redirects](https://nickcraver.com/blog/2020/02/11/binding-redirects/)
* [Current Status of Python Packaging - 2019](https://stefanoborini.com/current-status-of-python-packaging/)
* [ASP.NET Core MVC 3.x â€“ AddMvc(), AddMvcCore(), AddControllers() and other bootstrapping approaches](https://www.strathweb.com/2020/02/asp-net-core-mvc-3-x-addmvc-addmvccore-addcontrollers-and-other-bootstrapping-approaches/)
* [ASP.NET Core Integration Testing & Mocking using Moq](https://rehansaeed.com/asp-net-core-integration-testing-mocking-using-moq/)

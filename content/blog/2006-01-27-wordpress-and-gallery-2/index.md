As you may have noticed, this site now runs on [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) and [Gallery 2](http://gallery.menalto.com/). I then integrated the gallery into WordPress by using the [WPG2](http://wpg2.galleryembedded.com/) plug-in.

The next job is to do some design modifications and skinning so that it doesn't look like every other WordPress blog.

**Update:** I've just upgraded to WordPress 2.0.1 so the Gallery integration isn't all there yet.

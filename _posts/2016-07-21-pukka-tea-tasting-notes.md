I bought a [Pukka teas taster pack](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pukka-Herbal-Organic-Tea-Sachets/dp/B014V9D7U0/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1470060271&sr=8-1&keywords=pukka+selection) a few weeks ago, and kept notes so I could remember which ones I wanted to buy more of. These are my personal tastes and opinions, your results may differ!

**star anise & cinnamon** &#8211; &#8220;A velvety swirl of organic star anise, cinnamon & ginger&#8221; &#8211; Good but not sure I&#8217;d want to drink a whole box full, perhaps one for winter.

**lively english breakfast** &#8211; &#8220;A perky blend of organic whole leaf tea, ginseng & licorice&#8221; &#8211; Had this with milk. Quite good but a bit &#8220;fruity&#8221; for tea with milk. Not one I&#8217;ll be buying a box of.

**three tulsi** &#8211; &#8220;A sacred organic blend flowering with vibrant clarity&#8221; &#8211; A bit like Jasmine tea, not bad but a bit flowery for me.

**lemon, ginger & manuka honey** &#8211; &#8220;A welcoming cup of spicy-sweet organic bliss&#8221; &#8211; Very good, a classic. Though the manuka honey is only a flavouring, it doesn&#8217;t actually contain any. Not so good if left to go cold.

**cool mint green** &#8211; &#8220;An organic spearmint splash into green&#8217;s goodness&#8221; &#8211; Pretty much what it says on the tin &#8211; green tea with a hint of mint. A good combo &#8211; takes the edge of the green tea bitterness. Might buy this one.

**rooibos & honeybush** &#8211; &#8220;A copper red charm of organic earthy delight&#8221; &#8211; Not much to say really, tastes of rooibos &#8211; quite nice but not that keen personally.

**lemongrass & ginger** &#8211; &#8220;An uplifting organic lemony zing with a flying finish&#8221; &#8211; Not bad, hard to describe really &#8211; not quite as interesting as it sounds. Not interesting enough to consider buying any more. The lemony-ness is very subtle.

**licorice & cinnamon** &#8211; &#8220;A luxuriously sweet organic treasure gilded with golden spice&#8221; &#8211; You can&#8217;t really go wrong with this one &#8211; very nice, sweet and warming. Would buy again.

**lemon & mandarin with lemon verbena** &#8211; &#8220;An organic citrus sensation to cheer your senses&#8221; &#8211; Not quite as exciting or fruity as it sounds but a good fruity tea, similar to lemon and ginger I guess.

**detox** &#8211; &#8220;A lemony spring of organic aniseed, fennel & cardamom&#8221; &#8211; Nice and refreshing, light, lemony. Doubt it actually detoxes anything though!

**elderberry & echinacea with elderflower** &#8211; &#8220;A rich organic embrace tingling with fruity warmth&#8221; &#8211; Fruity, nice. Hard to distinguish all the flavours but would buy again.

**wild apple & cinnamon with ginger** &#8211; &#8220;A sunlit orchard of organic warmth & sweet spice&#8221; &#8211; Not bad and quite warming though not sure about the apple.

**blackcurrant beauty** &#8211; &#8220;Deliciously deep purple organic fruits to help you glow inside and out&#8221; &#8211; Blackcurranty, not much more to say.

**womankind** &#8211; &#8220;A delicate dance of organic cranberry, rose & sweet vanilla&#8221; &#8211; I had this in a pink mug to match the packaging. Not bad, lots of ingredients but none of them really stood out. Fairly generic &#8220;fruity&#8221; tea.

**clean green** &#8211; &#8220;A fresh burst of pure organic green tea with a luscious lemony lift&#8221; &#8211; Basically green tea with a hint of lemon. Pretty good though, takes the bitter edge off. I&#8217;d buy this if I wanted a green tea.

**vanilla chai** &#8211; &#8220;A caffeine-free organic lift flushed with cinnamon warmth&#8221; &#8211; Nicer than other chai teas I&#8217;ve had &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t really taste the vanilla but it seemed to work.

**relax** &#8211; &#8220;A deeply soothing fusion of organic chamomile, fennel & marshmallow root&#8221; &#8211; I had this on a stressful day to put it to the test &#8211; not sure if it worked or not. It was nice but not memorable &#8211; I probably wouldn&#8217;t buy this again.

**sweet vanilla green** &#8211; &#8220;A seductively sweet organic melody of soothing vanilla and whole leaf green tea&#8221; &#8211; Good but not that sweet and not much vanilla flavour. Better than plain green tea though.

**gorgeous earl grey** &#8211; &#8220;An inspiring infusion of organic whole leaf, bergamot & lavendar&#8221; &#8211; I&#8217;m not a massive earl grey fan but this one seemed pretty good &#8211; nice and smooth though I was left with a bitter taste when I&#8217;d finished the cup.

**three ginger** &#8211; &#8220;A warming swirl of organic ginger, galangal & golden turmeric&#8221; &#8211; It&#8217;s a good ginger tea, but it&#8217;s just ginger tea &#8211; couldn&#8217;t taste the other ingredients.

**three licorice** &#8211; &#8220;A sweet song of nourishing organic licorice from Kazakhstan, Pakistan & Egypt&#8221; &#8211; Very good and strong flavour but I think I still prefer the &#8220;peppermint & licorice&#8221; tea by Pukka.

**cleanse** &#8211; &#8220;A radiant blend of organic nettle, fennel & peppermint&#8221; &#8211; Hard to decribe, tasted mostly of peppermint but not as strong as a pure peppermint. Nice, but a bit boring.

**supreme matcha green** &#8211; &#8220;A vital wellspring of organic whole leaf green tea & the finest matcha&#8221; &#8211; Much like any other green tea I&#8217;ve had &#8211; a bit bitter but feels like it&#8217;s doing you good. The matcha is only 2% so probably more of a marketing gimmick than anything else.

**three fennel** &#8211; &#8220;Soothing organic sweet & wild fennel seeds with fennel leaf&#8221; &#8211; This smells pretty good and tastes ok too &#8211; a bit bland but I like it, I just don&#8217;t know why.

**chamomile, vanilla & manuka honey** &#8211; &#8220;A soothing dip in an organic pool of calm&#8221; &#8211; I was so calmed when I drank this that I&#8217;ve totally forgotten what it tasted like. It contains manuka honey flavouring, not actual manuka honey which is a bit of a swizz.

**three cinnamon** &#8211; &#8220;A sweet embrace of organic Indian, Indonesian & Vietnamese cinnamon&#8221; &#8211; Very cinnamony for obvious reasons &#8211; nice flavour, warming and has the best disclaimer &#8211; &#8220;Do not drink more than 4 cups a day&#8221;

**night time** &#8211; &#8220;organic oat flower, lavender & limeflower tea for peaceful sleep&#8221; &#8211; I had this during the afternoon and didn&#8217;t fall asleep (fortunately). It was pretty good, drinkable, hard to describe the flavour though &#8211; not as exotic a taste as the description might suggest.

**revitalise** &#8211; &#8220;A burst of warming organic cinnamon, cardamom & ginger&#8221; &#8211; Nice, smooth but not particularly memorable.

**after dinner** &#8211; &#8220;A delicious digestif of organic sweet fennel, roasted chicory & caradmom&#8221; &#8211; I had this mid-afternoon but I think it would go well after a big dinner, especially steak or similar.

**serene jasmine green** &#8211; &#8220;A sensual haven of organic green jasmine tea, chamomile & lavender&#8221; &#8211; Doesn&#8217;t taste as fancy or complicated as it sounds but good if you like that kind of flavour &#8211; I prefer the sweeter flavours personally.

**original chai** &#8211; &#8220;A royal flush of organic cinnamon, cardamom & ginger&#8221; &#8211; My favourite of the chai teas so far, or perhaps it&#8217;s just growing on me. I&#8217;d consider buying more of this one.

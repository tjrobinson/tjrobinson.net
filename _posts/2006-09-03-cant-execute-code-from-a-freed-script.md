Another good reason to hate Internet Explorer 6 and it&#8217;s hopeless error messages.

If you ever get the JavaScript (or should that be JScript) error &#8220;<span>Can&#8217;t execute code from a freed script&#8221; &#8211; try moving any meta tags in the head so that they&#8217;re before your script tags.</span>

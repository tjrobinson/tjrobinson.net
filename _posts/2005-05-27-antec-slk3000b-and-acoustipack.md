I recently bought a new case, the [Antec SLK3000B](http://www.antec.com/us/productDetails.php?ProdID=93000). The reason I&#8217;m posting this is that some people might be interested to know that the [AcoustiPackâ„¢ Pre-cut kit](http://www.acoustiproducts.com/en/acoustipack_precut.asp#APAntecBQE) for the [Antec SLK3700-BQE](http://www.antec.com/us/productDetails.php?ProdID=93703) is a perfect fit (with a couple of exceptions).

  * The left-hand side panel of the SLK3000B has two new ventilation holes. You just need to cut two holes in the foam before fitting it.
  * The foam block that fits under the hard drive caddy is too large because the design has changed significantly since the SLK3700-BQE. It&#8217;s not the end of the world though.
  * The air filter block at the front needs a couple of minor chunks cutting out because the cabling from the front of the case has moved slightly.

So I&#8217;ve still got two identical foam blocks left (one of which isn&#8217;t on the fitting instructions sheet) which I&#8217;ll probably try and find a use for once I can find a way of cutting them accurately. I&#8217;ve not got the rest of the computer up and running yet, but the AcoustiPack kits are well designed and I was impressed with the instructions.

I recently downloaded some files from Salesforce Chatter which ended in &#8220;&#8230;.&#8221; 

If Windows won&#8217;t let you delete them (it says they don&#8217;t exist), SysInternals sdelete will: 

C:\tools\SysinternalsSuite\sdelete.exe /s &#8220;\\?\C:\Users\TRobinson\Desktop\Over the next few weeks&#8230;.&#8221;

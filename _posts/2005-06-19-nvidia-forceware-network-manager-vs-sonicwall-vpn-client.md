After a lot of trial and error I&#8217;ve finally come to the conclusion that the [NVidia](http://www.nvidia.com/) ForceWare Network Manager can cause problems with the [SonicWall VPN Client](http://www.sonicwall.com/). I can&#8217;t say for certain as there are so many other things involved but after uninstalling it everything else seemed to start working as it should. I had the firewall disabled but it was still doing something to stop some VPN traffic going through. There&#8217;s some more detailed information on [Experts Exchange](http://www.experts-exchange.com/Software/Office_Productivity/Groupware/Outlook/Q_21459644.html)

## Books

- [ISC2 CISSP Certified Information Systems Security Professional Official Study Guide, 10th Edition](https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/ISC2+CISSP+Certified+Information+Systems+Security+Professional+Official+Study+Guide%2C+10th+Edition-p-9781394254705) - this is the official study guide (sometimes known as the OSG) and the common advice (which I also followed) is to get a copy, but don't read it cover to cover. Use it as a reference. It's pretty dry to read but does cover everything in depth. I got the Kindle version so I could search it as a reference.
- [Destination CISSP](https://destcert.com/cissp/guidebook-2024/)
- [CISSP: The Last Mile - Pete Zerger](https://leanpub.com/cissplastmile) - nice polished book covering everything in reasonable detail and ties in well with Pete's YouTube videos.
- [The Memory Palace](https://www.studynotesandtheory.com/single-post/memory-palace-cissp-notes) - very chaotic and not as polished as most of the other ebooks, but it is free and relatively concise. You might find the way some concepts are explained helps them sink in. I think there were a few inaccuracies though, so be careful.

## Cheat Sheets / Quick References

- [CertMike CISSP Last Minute Review Guide](https://certmike.com/cissp/) - for 9.99USD this is a pretty nice 16 page reference which covers everything at a high-level. I would recommend getting this early on while you're trying to work out which areas you need to work on as it's a lot quicker to skim through than a multi-hundred page book. It has some value as a last minute reference, but by the time you're at that point you should have most of it committed to memory already.

## Practice questions

- Wiley practice questions
- *Stank Industries* - to get to these you need to join the `#cissp` channel of the [Cybersecurity Station Discord](https://discord.com/invite/YzyBNNSHDZ) and then search for `in: cissp from: tresharley suggested answer`. These questions are really tricky but well worth going through towards the end of your studies to get you thinking really hard about the question and answers. Don't be surprised if you get most of them wrong, they're really tough. Save these for when you're happy with your knowledge, but need to learn exam technique.
- [Quantum Exams](https://quantumexams.com/) - expensive, but very similar to the real exam questions and they have a CAT simulation which is good for helping you understand how the scoring works. Save these for when you're happy with your knowledge, but need to learn exam technique.
- [LearnZapp](https://www.learnzapp.com/apps/cissp/)- this is the official app and I used it a lot, but mostly to find my weak areas and for learning the content. Most of the questions are much easier than in the real exam and much more straightforward and direct. Once you're scoring at least 70%, I'd move on to harder practice questons.
- [Destination Certification app](https://destcert.com/destcert-app/) - harder questions than LearnZapp, free, and has flashcards too. Some questions felt like they'd been recycled from other certifications (especially CCSP) but pretty good overall. I got nowhere near completing them all though. 
- [Deluxe CertMike Practice Exam and Live Review Session](https://certmike.com/cissp/) - I did this about 4 weeks out from the exam. The questions were fairly easy (similar to LearnZapp) and I don't think were a good reflection of the complexity/wording of the real exam. The result I got suggested I was ready for the exam, but I didn't agree. If you get this I would do it much earlier on when you want to find your weaker domains. The best part was having a quick chat with Mike Chappell himself in the Live Review Session afterwards. Great if you have any questions for him.

## Email newsletters

- [DestCert Weekly email newsletter](https://destcert.com/newsletter-signup/) - well written interesting content, even if it always ends with an attempt to sell you their courses (which is fair enough).
- [Luke Ahmed email newsletter](https://studynotesandtheory.mykajabi.com/opt-in-f7fa2293-a9e1-4afe-90b1-250e3c0e6978) - a bit chaotic but some interesting content, practice questions and encouragement made these worth reading.

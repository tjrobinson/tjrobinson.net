## Giving Negative Feedback

The exact approach depends on the issue, but some general principles are:

1. **Check your facts beforehand** - Speak to the person who was upset, get hard facts and figures for performance issues.
2. **Give feedback as soon as is reasonably possible** - Don't wait for the next 1:1.
3. **Give feedback face to face** - Avoid dropping a brief Teams message or email highlighting the mistake. If in the office, choose a private setting.
4. **Start by checking your assumptions** - "I've become aware that XYZ. Is that right? I want to hear your side of it. Please could you tell me a bit more about this?"
5. **Avoid "why" questions** - They put the person on the defensive ("Why the hell did you do that?!"). Better to ask "What" questions:
   - "What made you choose that course of action?"
   - "What were you hoping to accomplish?"
   - "What's important to you here?"
6. **Avoid attacking their character** - Use "I" statements to avoid sounding accusatory: "When you behave like this, I feel the consequence for the team is..."
7. **Frame the discussion as helping them grow** - Also emphasise nipping this in the bud so it doesn't become a bigger problem. Make it as safe as possible so they don't feel threatened (assuming this is the first time you've discussed the issue). Remember, people generally don't want to do a poor job or cause upset.
8. **Agree a plan to improve** - Try to set specific goals and milestones (e.g., go two weeks without making hurtful/negative comments in a team meeting).
9. **Set a date to review** - Discuss ongoing milestones and support they may need.
10. **Send an email summary** - Document the discussion, next steps, and timescales. This forms an evidence/audit trail if the problem persists and HR need to get involved.

## Books

- **The Effective Manager** by Mark Horstman - A bit old school but has good advice about 1:1s and giving feedback. Skim read to find the useful/relevant bits.

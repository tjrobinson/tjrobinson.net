# Access Packages

## Known issues

- Confusion and feature differences between `beta` and `v1` API
- PATCH endpoints missing for many resources, e.g. policies
- PIM vs Access Packages
- Hourly access not supported for access packages
- Multiple approval stages not supported for PIM?
- Custom extensions - can we remove need for Logic Apps and just use HTTP calls
- Terraform provider - needs updating to use `v1` API

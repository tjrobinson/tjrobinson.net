I bought a [Pukka teas taster pack](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pukka-Herbal-Organic-Tea-Sachets/dp/B014V9D7U0/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1470060271&sr=8-1&keywords=pukka+selection) a few weeks ago, and kept notes so I could remember which ones I wanted to buy more of. These are my personal tastes and opinions, your results may differ!

**star anise & cinnamon** - "A velvety swirl of organic star anise, cinnamon & ginger" - Good but not sure I'd want to drink a whole box full, perhaps one for winter.

**lively english breakfast** - "A perky blend of organic whole leaf tea, ginseng & licorice" - Had this with milk. Quite good but a bit "fruity" for tea with milk. Not one I'll be buying a box of.

**three tulsi** - "A sacred organic blend flowering with vibrant clarity" - A bit like Jasmine tea, not bad but a bit flowery for me.

**lemon, ginger & manuka honey** - "A welcoming cup of spicy-sweet organic bliss" - Very good, a classic. Though the manuka honey is only a flavouring, it doesn't actually contain any. Not so good if left to go cold.

**cool mint green** - "An organic spearmint splash into green's goodness" - Pretty much what it says on the tin - green tea with a hint of mint. A good combo - takes the edge of the green tea bitterness. Might buy this one.

**rooibos & honeybush** - "A copper red charm of organic earthy delight" - Not much to say really, tastes of rooibos - quite nice but not that keen personally.

**lemongrass & ginger** - "An uplifting organic lemony zing with a flying finish" - Not bad, hard to describe really - not quite as interesting as it sounds. Not interesting enough to consider buying any more. The lemony-ness is very subtle.

**licorice & cinnamon** - "A luxuriously sweet organic treasure gilded with golden spice" - You can't really go wrong with this one - very nice, sweet and warming. Would buy again.

**lemon & mandarin with lemon verbena** - "An organic citrus sensation to cheer your senses" - Not quite as exciting or fruity as it sounds but a good fruity tea, similar to lemon and ginger I guess.

**detox** - "A lemony spring of organic aniseed, fennel & cardamom" - Nice and refreshing, light, lemony. Doubt it actually detoxes anything though!

**elderberry & echinacea with elderflower** - "A rich organic embrace tingling with fruity warmth" - Fruity, nice. Hard to distinguish all the flavours but would buy again.

**wild apple & cinnamon with ginger** - "A sunlit orchard of organic warmth & sweet spice" - Not bad and quite warming though not sure about the apple.

**blackcurrant beauty** - "Deliciously deep purple organic fruits to help you glow inside and out" - Blackcurranty, not much more to say.

**womankind** - "A delicate dance of organic cranberry, rose & sweet vanilla" - I had this in a pink mug to match the packaging. Not bad, lots of ingredients but none of them really stood out. Fairly generic "fruity" tea.

**clean green** - "A fresh burst of pure organic green tea with a luscious lemony lift" - Basically green tea with a hint of lemon. Pretty good though, takes the bitter edge off. I'd buy this if I wanted a green tea.

**vanilla chai** - "A caffeine-free organic lift flushed with cinnamon warmth" - Nicer than other chai teas I've had - I couldn't really taste the vanilla but it seemed to work.

**relax** - "A deeply soothing fusion of organic chamomile, fennel & marshmallow root" - I had this on a stressful day to put it to the test - not sure if it worked or not. It was nice but not memorable - I probably wouldn't buy this again.

**sweet vanilla green** - "A seductively sweet organic melody of soothing vanilla and whole leaf green tea" - Good but not that sweet and not much vanilla flavour. Better than plain green tea though.

**gorgeous earl grey** - "An inspiring infusion of organic whole leaf, bergamot & lavendar" - I'm not a massive earl grey fan but this one seemed pretty good - nice and smooth though I was left with a bitter taste when I'd finished the cup.

**three ginger** - "A warming swirl of organic ginger, galangal & golden turmeric" - It's a good ginger tea, but it's just ginger tea - couldn't taste the other ingredients.

**three licorice** - "A sweet song of nourishing organic licorice from Kazakhstan, Pakistan & Egypt" - Very good and strong flavour but I think I still prefer the "peppermint & licorice" tea by Pukka.

**cleanse** - "A radiant blend of organic nettle, fennel & peppermint" - Hard to decribe, tasted mostly of peppermint but not as strong as a pure peppermint. Nice, but a bit boring.

**supreme matcha green** - "A vital wellspring of organic whole leaf green tea & the finest matcha" - Much like any other green tea I've had - a bit bitter but feels like it's doing you good. The matcha is only 2% so probably more of a marketing gimmick than anything else.

**three fennel** - "Soothing organic sweet & wild fennel seeds with fennel leaf" - This smells pretty good and tastes ok too - a bit bland but I like it, I just don't know why.

**chamomile, vanilla & manuka honey** - "A soothing dip in an organic pool of calm" - I was so calmed when I drank this that I've totally forgotten what it tasted like. It contains manuka honey flavouring, not actual manuka honey which is a bit of a swizz.

**three cinnamon** - "A sweet embrace of organic Indian, Indonesian & Vietnamese cinnamon" - Very cinnamony for obvious reasons - nice flavour, warming and has the best disclaimer - "Do not drink more than 4 cups a day"

**night time** - "organic oat flower, lavender & limeflower tea for peaceful sleep" - I had this during the afternoon and didn't fall asleep (fortunately). It was pretty good, drinkable, hard to describe the flavour though - not as exotic a taste as the description might suggest.

**revitalise** - "A burst of warming organic cinnamon, cardamom & ginger" - Nice, smooth but not particularly memorable.

**after dinner** - "A delicious digestif of organic sweet fennel, roasted chicory & caradmom" - I had this mid-afternoon but I think it would go well after a big dinner, especially steak or similar.

**serene jasmine green** - "A sensual haven of organic green jasmine tea, chamomile & lavender" - Doesn't taste as fancy or complicated as it sounds but good if you like that kind of flavour - I prefer the sweeter flavours personally.

**original chai** - "A royal flush of organic cinnamon, cardamom & ginger" - My favourite of the chai teas so far, or perhaps it's just growing on me. I'd consider buying more of this one.

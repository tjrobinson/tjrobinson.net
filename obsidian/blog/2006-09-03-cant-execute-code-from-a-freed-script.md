# Can't execute code from a freed script


Another good reason to hate Internet Explorer 6 and it's hopeless error messages.

If you ever get the JavaScript (or should that be JScript) error "Can't execute code from a freed script" - try moving any meta tags in the head so that they're before your script tags.

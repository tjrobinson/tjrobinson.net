# 2019-09-22-migration-to-gatsby


I'm currently migrating my blog from Jekyll to Gatsby - mostly because I don't know Ruby, which Jekyll is written in, but I do know JavaScript, which Gatsby uses. It's also a good chance for some exposure to React.

Lots of things will be broken, and old posts missing, until I get everything migrated properly.
